My intention for this post was to write about an irritating advert that is currently running on US television right now. Beforehand, I did a quick Google search so that I could link to the product in question. In doing so I found a number of blogs and discussion forums already talking about it and quickly realised that by adding myself to that number, I would be walking into an age old marketing trap.

I'm a firm believer that all bad ad campaigns are created because a.) they require little investment, b.) they require little thought yet c.) they generate the most interest. People talk about it in the office, or on blogs and online as seen here. 

Little effort, huge reward.

I'm not sure it matters much that people may be talking about the product in a negative way either, the fact that are talking about it creates a familiarity and awareness of the brand/product.

This particular advert is excellent proof of this concept; essentially a few product shots shown to a soundtrack that consists of a reworded version of EMF's <cite>Unbelievable</cite>, which I'm sure I've seen done numerous times before.

So in [my continuing campaign][1] to not reward ideas that lack imagination, I finish this entry without one link or reference to a product, that frankly, I could happily live without anyway.
