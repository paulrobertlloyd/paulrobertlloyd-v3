My esteemed colleague, Cennydd Bowles:

> Hover states can provide subtle visual cues that help the user understand how something works. A faint glow around a 'favourite' star. An underline appearing underneath a link. But they should not be used for anything else. Hovering does not demonstrate user intent.
