> We're building a real-time social service where users and developers come first, not advertisers.

> Our team has spent the last 9 years building social services, developer platforms, mobile applications and more.
>
> We believe that advertising-supported social services are so consistently and inextricably at odds with the interests of users and developers that something must be done.
>
> Help us create the service we all wish existed.

Putting my money where my mouth's been for the last few years, and backing this audacious project. I hope it succeeds.
