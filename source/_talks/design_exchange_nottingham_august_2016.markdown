title: 'Designing Systems: Theory, Practice, and the Unfortunate In-between'
date: '2016-08-10 20:15:00 +0100'
excerpt: |
  As our lives grow increasingly reliant on digital products and services, designers are asked to to deliver coherent experiences across a multitude of platforms and formats, without sacrificing development efficiency and maintainability.

  It's no surprise then, that our industry should find itself obsessed with style guides, pattern libraries and modular front-end frameworks. Not a day passes without a new design system being showcased or a tool launched that promises to ease their creation. Yet, without considering the audiences that will use these systems, and the changing factors that may effect their usefulness, these new tools could do more harm than good.
