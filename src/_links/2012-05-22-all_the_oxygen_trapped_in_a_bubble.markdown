David Heinemeier Hansson:

> Sure, people are being employed, money is changing hands, but come Monday morning, the hangover is that we spent a bundle to build a lot of shit that's not going anywhere. As a result, we missed out on doing other worthwhile things. All those smart and talented heads, and all those benjamins, didn't progress the economic base in a way we're going to care about tomorrow. And that's a damn shame.

Put another way, "the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads" -- [that's the view of Jeff Hammerbacher][1], an early employee of Facebook.
