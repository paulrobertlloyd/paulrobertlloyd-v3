Thanks to [London Open House][1], last month [Simon][2] and I visited the Commonwealth Institute, regarded by English Heritage as the second most important modern building in London (after Royal Festival Hall). Neglected for ten years, work will soon begin on preparing the site for the New Design Museum, scheduled to open in 2014.

Having exhibited here in 2002, I look forward to seeing how the building will adapt to meet its new purpose. I've posted [photos from my visit][3] on Flickr. You can also [view Simon's photos][4] too.
