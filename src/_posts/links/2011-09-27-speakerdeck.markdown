I quickly tired of posting my presentations to SlideShare as the service became increasingly laden with features and countless advertising.

Thankfully there's now an alternative in the form of Speaker Deck, which [publicly launched this week][1]. Designed by [Ordered List][2], this new service gives presentations the distraction free environment they deserve, and is an exemplar of detail-driven design. Don't let the simplicity of the product fool you. Attention has been fostered on even the tiniest details; skim over thumbnail images to see what I mean. 

If you have presentations you wish to showcase, I encourage you to try Speaker Deck. You won't be disappointed.
