Tim Jackson:

> The care and concern of one human being for another is a peculiar "commodity." It can't be stockpiled. It becomes degraded through trade. It isn't delivered by machines. Its quality rests entirely on the attention paid by one person to another. Even to speak of reducing the time involved is to misunderstand its value.
