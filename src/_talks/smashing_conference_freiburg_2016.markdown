title: 'Designing Systems: Theory, Practice, and the Unfortunate In-between'
date: '2016-09-13 11:15:00 +0200'
excerpt: 'As our lives grow increasingly reliant on digital products, designers are asked to deliver coherent experiences across a multitude of platforms, all without sacrificing development efficiency and maintainability.
