I've finally uploaded my [photos from this year's Coed-y-Brenin weekender][1]. Whilst this annual weekend in Wales is still referred to as 'Coed-y-Brenin', we stopped biking in that forest many years ago, and now visit other attractions near the campsite in Dolgellau instead.

This year [Mark][2], [Dave][3], [Jon][4] and I climbed Snowdon, the highest mountain in England and Wales. It was a gorgeous day and the views weren't disappointing either.
