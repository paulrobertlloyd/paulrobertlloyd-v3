[Emil Nolde’s colourful and expressionist work](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/emil-nolde-colour-life) appeals to my aesthetic sensibilities. Yet his anti-Semitic views and support of the Nazis (who deemed him to be a ‘degenerative artist’) make him hard to admire. It’s that age old quandary; can you separate art from its artist?
