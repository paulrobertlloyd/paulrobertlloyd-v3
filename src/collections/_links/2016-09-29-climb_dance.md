> Climb Dance is a famous cinéma vérité short film, which features Finnish rally driver Ari Vatanen setting a record time in a highly modified four-wheel drive, all-wheel steering Peugeot 405 Turbo 16 GR at the 1988 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in Colorado, USA. The film was produced by Peugeot and directed by Jean Louis Mourey.

I love everything about this film (which I had not seen until [Adam Perfect mentioned it][1] on his blog): the cinematography, the score, and of course Vatanen's daring cliff-edge driving.
