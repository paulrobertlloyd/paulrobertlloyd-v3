      Nice one Lloydy and excellent photos, I should have done a similar thing really. On New Years Eve I fell asleep at 11:30 so i missed out on the whole midnight celebration lol.

      Great photo work, fantastic blog layout for showing them. Jealousy is still rife in 2009.

      Beautiful photos.

      The last time I did the big night out for NYE was the millennium, the new year has seemed of relatively little consequence since then. It was also the night I met my wife.

      I spent New Years day being sick, and going back to bed at 6pm...
