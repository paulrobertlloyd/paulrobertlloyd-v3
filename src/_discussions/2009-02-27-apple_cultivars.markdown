      I've got a similar setup, naming all my Apple gear... except mine are named after elderly women.

      * MBP: Blanche
      * 30" Cinema Display: Estelle
      * iPhone: Maude
      * iPod: Edith
      * External HD1: Rosemary
      * External HD2: Agnes

      Helps me make my workspace my own... everyone knows their names around the office, too :).

      This is a great idea. Unfortunately I've no specific naming conventions with the exception of my external hard drives which I named after cartoon characters (Zim and GIR). I might stretch the cartoon naming convention out to my iPhone and other devices but I might try and find something a little more interesting :)

      Never named any Apple stuff anything different from the normal "Andrew Yates' X". Sounds a pretty cool idea, I like the HMS Discovery idea alot.

      I wondered what I could use to name all of my Apple gear.

      Our home network is the 100 Acre Wood, with the various devices being named after the characters who inhabit it.
