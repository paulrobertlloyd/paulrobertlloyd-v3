      Very nice. The one thing I would like would be the one meatspace connection I still use, the phone. Skype too.

      OK, not social media, per se, but if you want a complete contact page :)

      Thanks for the kind words everybody!

      [@Stuart](#remark-4): I plan to add icons for all the major IM providers in the next release, including AIM, Yahoo, Messenger, GTalk and Skype. An icon for a generic phone sounds like a good idea, although you are right it falls slightly outside the remit for these icons. I'll have to have a think about this.

      Every one of these icons is a rip-off of my friend Rogie King's icons at Komodo Media: <http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/>

      Why would you do this?

      Hi Mike,

      Obviously I would like to rebut your claims of these icons as being direct rip-offs of those icons by Rogie King.

      I note that on Twitter [you have apologised](http://twitter.com/mike9r/status/2740676784), and stated that you believe I had mistakenly linked to Rogie's icons, but had since changed the link. I'm slightly confused by this claim as this is just not true. This download link has not changed since I published this post. My guess is that you saw the 16x16 icons previewed above, and without downloading the file and inspecting it's   content: s, left a comment here (and more damagingly) made the same claims on Twitter (resulting in the predictable thoughtless re-tweeting by others).

      But in the spirit of full disclosure, I am happy to provide a little more background on how these icons came into being.

      In the past I had found that the only suitable 16x16 icons available for linking to different social networks were the favicons used by the respective websites, yet these were often visually inconsistent and in some cases, rather ugly.

      After doing some similar icons for a client in April, I decided that I would rectify this and spend some time creating a set of icons for my favourite social networks, with my two key goals being that they didn't stray too far from the original favicons (YouTube excluded -- I absolutely hate their favicon!) and that they all had a consistent appearance.

      At this time I had seen [Rogie's initial set of icons](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2008/12/social-media-mini-iconpack/) (as noted in the above post) and also the gorgeous icons created by [Tim Van Damme](http://timvandamme.com/) for use on his address card site, whose icons inspired me to create the larger icon sizes. I completed most of these during the May Bank Holiday, but being a perfectionist (and susceptible to chronic bouts of procrastination) I never finished the entire set.

      However two things spurred me on to bite the bullet and finish my icons. Firstly a discussion with my colleagues in the pub about not worrying too much about trying to achieve perfection (i.e. 'Great Artists Ship') and secondly seeing that Rogie had released his updated set of icons.

      This was of course my worse fear. When I created my icons nobody had done a set of popular social network icons in sizes greater than 16x16, but I knew it was only a matter of time before somebody would, and Rogie did (and they are [a fantastic set of icons](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/)).

      Rogie is obviously a far more talented illustrator than I am, and I love that each of his icons reflect his own unique style. Yet at the same time this is precisely why I wanted to create my own icons -- I wanted icons with a more generic feel, simply customised so that they felt like they belonged to the same family.

      Now these icons may not be *that* different to Rogie's, but how could they be? After all both sets of icons are built upon the same foundations -- that of the logos and colours of the respective social networking services. However each and every pixel of these icons has been crafted by my own fair hands, and many hours have been spent working on them.

      I apologise for the lengthy reply, but it may not surprise you that I'm a little annoyed by your comments, both here and on Twitter (with its [rather flimsy retraction](http://twitter.com/mike9r/status/2740676784)). If you don't like my icons, then of course that's your own personal opinion, but please don't insult me by claiming I am some sort of rip-off artist. I find such comments unhelpful.

      Hey Paul, like I said on Twitter just now I swear I clicked to download your icons, opened up the ZIP, and I saw Rogie's icons. I did this 3x and had the same result. Initially your ZIP file was 0 bytes and I thought something odd was going on, my only explanation is that your ZIP was named exactly the same as Rogie's and I had his in the same folder. After I deleted all ZIPs in my Downloads folder I gave it another shot and finally saw your actual icons which are very, very nice.

      You have my sincerest apologies and immediately after I discovered my mistake I deleted the tweets that contained my remarks and apologized. As Rogie has mentioned I would not do something like this maliciously, it was a mistake on my part, and I'm very sorry.

      Thanks for getting back to me on this Mike, it seem as though technology has failed us once again. Apology excepted.

      I guess the thing that annoyed me most about this whole episode was clicking on 'Mentions' in Tweetie, to see tens of re-tweets of your original status update, which in effect magnified the intensity of your original claim.

      Anyway, the subject of retweeting merits an entirely different blog post devoted to it (and another thing I've delayed doing). I guess I should get it written up before Rogie beats me to it ;-)

      This is such a giddy-great set of icons, Paul! It's definitely the most comprehensive set I've found online.

      As some others have said, I'd love to see Viddler in this package too. We have an icon already that should fit perfectly: <http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/8150/128&#120;128e.png>

      E-mail me if you have questions.

      Again, you've done a top notch job!

      Have to agree with everyone else -- the set looks great! I'm using them in my redesign that I hope to push out in the next week or two.

      I needed a friendfeed icon to match, so I made one -- you're welcome to it to add to the set if you'd like ([I have the 32 & 24 sizes done](http://www.flickr.com/photos/studiochris/3918877500/sizes/o/)). Just email the address in the comment and I'll send the PSDs.

      good idea, would be even "lighter" to put them as a sprite, and use a .class to display, cf yahoo! sprites

      I love these icons -- I only wish the YouTube icon showed the actual YouTube logo, rather than a white arrow on a red background. I'm afraid no one will know what it refers to. Otherwise, great work!

      Hello.

      I'm currently working on a webdesign for a friend who's going to start a professional website and since he wants graphical objects for his network menu, I'm currently looking for CreativeCommons 16x16 social icons. These icons would be perfect if there was an icon for blogs, as he wants to set up a blog alongside with the pro website, and I want the icons to be consistants between each other. Because of the missing icon, I will have to look for icons elsewhere, unfortunately.

      Hi Paul,

      Do you have a 32x32 icon for Soup? I have used your tumblr icon from my site <http://www.mediahelpingmedia.org/> for my tumblr site <http://mediahelpingmedia.tumblr.com/>, but I find Soup better, so I am running a Soup site, too. <http://mediahelpingmedia.soup.io/>. I can try to make a Soup 32x32 but it would look shabby alongside the other icons.

      I need some assistance. I am not very computer literate, but can make my way around. I am trying to download the social media icons and believe I have done that.

      However, I don't know how to (A) view them on my computer without going through all of this zip/unzip stuff and (B) don't know how to put the icon on my email and embed a hyperlink to it.

      Can someone help me out?

      Hi Paul, I love the icons (and use them on my site - with attribution, of course) but find myself wishing you had a Github icon.

      I built my own poor facsimile for now (here: <http://x451.com/images/icons.png>) but just wanted to point it out! You're missing the de facto programming social network.

      Thanks for the amazing work!

      Hey Paul, I recently updated some of my icons to yours, they're nice. The one exception is YouTube -- the play button isn't really recognized as youtube, it's usually their square logotype.

      Any thoughts on changing/updating that to their red/white logo they use?

      Hello all,

      It's been a while since I responded to the comments in the thread, so I'll attempt to answer some of your questions now.

      In terms of adding additional icons, I'm currently considering adding the following icons in the next up  date:

      * Retweet
      * Github
      * Spotify
      * BBC iD

      Given the current number of icons in this package, I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on which icons should now be *removed*.
      With regards to icons for WordPress and Blogger, I encourage you to read my most recent blog post on the matter: [Social Media Icons: A Rationale](http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2010/03/social_media_icons_rationale).
      The short answer is that I don't plan on adding icons for every type publishing platform -- especially when the 'Website' icon fulfils this role. Nor do I anticipate updating the YouTube icon to match the current favicon, because frankly, it's ugly.
      I am thinking about ways in which I can provide a template file with this package though, which would allow you to create your own icons in a similar style. If you have suggestions as to which format(s) this should be  available in, please let me know!

      Thanks for your support,
      Paul

      Hi, I was looking for a great social media icon pack and luckily stumbled upon yours. Thanks for this.

      Regarding your last comment, I would like the template to be available in .psd and Fireworks .png formats. :)

      I would like to have the template as a .pds-File and a partly-transparent .png-file (so that you can just lay it over an existing icon) and this icons should you remove in my opinion:

      * OPML
      * Huffduffer
      * Just Giving
      * Goodreads
      * Ffffound
      * Brightkite
      * Fire Eagle
      * Viddler
      * Ning
      * Netvibes
      * Mixx
      * Upcoming
      * Newsvine

      Two suggestions:

      1. How about a generic RSS icon?
      2. Would you consider making them into one or more large pallets suitable for embedding via the CSS sprite technique? I'll probably wind up making my own collage of icons, but having them available grouped into a few large images would be helpful for embedding in large Web applications.

      Awesome work! Thank you very much indeed.

      I'd second the suggestion of a Google Reader icon, and would also suggest icons for Libre.fm, Filmaker.com and iheartmovies.com.

      Perhaps the addition of a blank icon to the pack could help others rolling their own particular icons without hassling you so much? Just a suggestion, of course.

      Speaking of which: as I assume we all prefer using your icons instead of text links (that's why we're here, after all!), may I also suggest that you add an icon to your own website, so that we may link back to you with style? ;)

      Thank you again and best regards.

      Thank you for creating these and sharing them. They are well-crafted and each of the icons plays well with others. I am especially pleased that you included email, iTunes, and AIM icons, as these are (apparently) often overlooked by icon designers. Email and AIM are social networks too!

      Firstly, thank you for this amazing set of icons. These are clearly the best looking. Secondly, I think this set needs a Fiverr bookmark as fiverr.com is gaining popularity and has built a basis for some many people's talents and offers. Another website that I think deserves an icon of your awesome set is Cuil, the search engine established by former Google employees.

      Is there any chance you could do some extras? Specifically:

      * [gdgt](http://gdgt.com/)
      * [Wakoopa](http://social.wakoopa.com/)
      * [Raptr](http://raptr.com/)

      They're three fairly well known and fairly popular social networks so I think they'd be a valid addition to the pack. :)

      Also, the "google-16x16" icon looks a little blurry if you look carefully, and not as crisp as other icons in the set. Any chance you could refine that a little?

      GREAT WORK! I really appreciate the effort you put into these, cleanest looking set of icons i've seen.

      Just echoing one of the previous suggestions, an RSS icon would be pretty essential for the set. I noticed you have a nice looking on in this site's header, so maybe you could use that? Thanks!
