      Ahhh... so wish I could make it to this! But for some reason I thought it'd be a good idea to run 13 miles on the Sunday.

      BTW, I'm really enjoying these 1 a day posts mate, keep up the good work! You can do it!

      Wow, that's pretty cool, Paul! Having small "conventions" like this a is great way to keep up on industry trends and build a more collaborative team of qualified professionals.

      We took our first steps to a similar idea here in Campbell, CA -- it's called the ZURBsoapbox, an open discussion about a topic. Love ideas like these; reminds me of other movements like the Refresh events and even larger conferences.

      Best of luck!
