Ning is an online platform that allows people to create, customise and share their own social networks. I was its lead designer from January 2006 to October 2007.

In addition to interaction design and front-end development on the company's initial suite of applications, I was also responsible for the company's branding and product marketing. Later, I worked alongside [David Warner][1] on the development of what became the company's primary product: "Your Own Social Network".

  quote="Paul and I worked closely together for a year as the two people responsible for the design and HTML/CSS code for Ning. Paul is a very gifted graphic and interaction designer who works hard and quickly. He is also one of the strongest HTML/CSS coders I've ever worked with. He cares passionately about his work and it shows: high quality and attention to detail."

  quote="Paul gave Ning its look: from its distinctive Clarendon logo to the HTML and CSS undergirding Ning's 150,000 social networks. Working with Paul's semantically rich CSS designs is a pleasure. With the simple addition of a CSS class like `response`, amazing things would happen to an HTML element: the avatar would shift to the opposite side, the speech bubble flip on its vertical axis, the colors change subtly. He writes of his <q>passion for web standards and attractive design</q> -- it certainly shows in his beautiful work."
