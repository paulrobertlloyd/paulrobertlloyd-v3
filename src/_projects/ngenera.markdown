nGenera Corporation (now [Moxie Software][1]) helps companies and governments transform themselves into forward thinking enterprises: organisations that enable employees to communicate via real-time social software platforms and tools.

Steve Douty (president of platforms, applications and marketing) asked me to take the new nGenera name (the company was formerly BSG Alliance) and build a brand that could encompass its growing suite of software products and consultation services.

## Brand Identity
With an intriguing -- if not immediately obvious -- name, the logo needed to reflect the organisation's broad ambition and signify a break with any past notions of enterprise. Combining an 'n' and 'G' in a subtle and intriguing manner, allowed me to create a symbol that felt similar to those commonly associated with networking and connectivity.

{% figure caption:"nGenera symbol and wordmark" %}
{% include image.html path="projects/ngenera/logo.png" alt="The nGenera logo" %}
{% endfigure %}

This distinctive mark could work at many sizes, with flat and rendered versions created to suit different applications. To encompass a range of operating devisions, a brand architecture was also created that meant future acquisitions could easily be integrated into the overall brand.

{% endfigure %}

While other in-house and third-party teams were responsible for implementing the brand, I provided overall guidance and created example collateral pieces such as reports, signage and business cards.

## Website
I sought to distinguish nGenera's web presence by creating an immersive and premium experience, realised through the use of deep blues accented by highly saturated colours from a complementary palette. Working with [Matt Pearson][2], I produced an carousel device for use on the homepage that introduced customers to the company's range of products and services.
