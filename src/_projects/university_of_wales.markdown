The University of Wales is a confederal university responsible for accrediting degrees for institutions in Wales and for courses provided overseas.

Working with [James Box][1] at Clearleft, I created an extensible design language that could be applied across the website, microsites and the myWales social e-learning network.

{% include image.html preset="supporting" path="projects/university_of_wales/mywales.png" alt="Sample page from myWales e-learning section of the website" class="u-framed" %}
{% endfigure %}
