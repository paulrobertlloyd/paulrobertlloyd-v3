Mozilla Add-ons is a catalogue of over 6,000 add-ons that allows Firefox users to customise the browser to suit their individual interests and needs.

The previous site proved unappealing to users who were less tech savvy. Mozilla wanted to reposition add-ons as thousands of ways to improve the way you do things online. Working alongside [Richard Rutter][1], [Natalie Downe][2] and [Anna Debenham][3] at Clearleft, I created a design that was more consumer-orientated and approachable.
