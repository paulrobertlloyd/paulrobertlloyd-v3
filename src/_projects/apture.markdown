Apture was a publishing tool that gave content creators the power to find and incorporate multimedia directly into their webpages.

Working alongside Apture's CEO Tristan Harris and his small team, often on-site at their offices in San Mateo, I helped launch the initial product in April 2008 before developing later iterations of the product.

> I've worked alongside some of the most brilliant interaction and graphic designers in the world in my career, but Paul is one of the most talented and consistently impressive designers I've met. Beyond driving most of Apture's graphic, interaction and web design work, he cares deeply about building beautiful, visually organised products, which I think is why we both got along in the first place.
