This website is produced on an [Apple Mac][1], using [Sketch][2] to realise early design concepts before being coded in [Atom][3]. I use and recommend [WebFaction][4] for web hosting. Type is set in [Calibre][5] which is designed by Kris Sowersby.

This site is published using [Jekyll][6] and these supporting plugins:

  * [jekyll-archives][7] by Alfred Xing
  * [jekyll-assets][8] by Jordon Bedwell
  * [jekyll-sitemap][9] by GitHub, Inc.
  * [jekyll-smartify][10] by Pat Hawks
  * [jekyll-compress-html][11] by Anatol Broder
  * [Simple Jekyll Search][12] by Christian Fei

Other notable tools and services used to build this site include:

  * [fontfaceobserver][13] by Bram Stein
  * [Picturefill][14] by Filament Group, Inc.
  * [What Input?][15] by Jeremy Fields
  * [Susy][16] by Miriam E. Suzanne
  * [typogruby][17] by Arjan van der Gaag
  * [MapBox][18] by Mapbox Inc.

Pages are semantically structured using valid [HTML5][19] with presentational design provided by [CSS][20]. Syndicated feeds use [Atom][21]-flavoured RSS.
