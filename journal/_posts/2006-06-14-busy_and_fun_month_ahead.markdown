## @media 2006
<img class="right" src="/assets/2006/06/atmedia2006.png" alt="@media2006 logo" />This evening I step on a train that is London bound, ready to spend Thursday and Friday in HTML heaven! I really enjoyed [@media last year][1], and I have been looking forward to this years event with much anticipation. Since last June, I have jumped the sinking ship that was <del>Orange Dreams</del> <del>River Internet</del> Orange Vision and now find myself deep inside the [Ning][2] trenches.

As such, I'm hoping this years panels and speakers will point me in the direction of some of the cool stuff that's been going on in the web standards scene, and the topics that I perhaps haven't had much time to devote to of late. I'm also desperately trying to redevelop this website, and whilst I already have pages of ideas, I'm pretty sure that by Friday evening I will be itching to get stuck in again.

The most enjoyable aspect of @media2005 was the after show parties and socialising with my peers and heroes. Unlike last year, I have now been in contact with a couple of the web 'stars', and have also become involved with the [Multipack][3] -- many whose members have also managed to wangle a ticket or two! It of course will also be good to meet some new people too.

## Rome
Later, on the 22nd of this month, I will be again heading down to London (and once again claiming my brothers sofa) to met up with Nancy and her sister who arrive in the capital that weekend. My brother has promised them a tour of the 'real London' too -- this I've got to see! I will then be spending a week in Rome -- if only to quiet those that think it's bizarre for a Englishman not to have set foot on the continent! I'm really looking forward to this one, especially given this will be my first trip to a country that isn't English speaking.

## New Ning Goodness
Lastly, this month sees the release of some great new features me and the team at Ning have been working away on -- I can't say too much right now, but I promise you, it's one not to be missed!
