Yesterday, I received a text message I never thought I would:

> Hi Paul, astounding news, I (Lee Nash) have a mobile...

Now for those that know Lee, this is shocking news. To his credit he has resisted this technological progression for nearly 7 years, but perhaps less impressive is that this meant we would only ever see him at Christmas, when he would be near a fixed line phone!

Getting the man on film however, is still near on impossible -- perhaps going to show that some things will never change!
