This last weekend me, Ellen, Nash, Hannah and Charis joined Jon on a visit south to Littlehampton where we spent two days with his girlfriend Katie and her mates, at a house she was looking after. I have to say this has probably been one of the best weekends I've enjoyed in a long while. I drove down with Nash and Ellen (who in full control of the CD player gave us a great mix of tunes), arriving in 'LA' to enjoy the tail-end of a house party.

We spent Saturday morning on and around Littlehampton beach, before heading over to Brighton in the evening for some [comedy][1] (narrowly missing much of Gay Pride that was happening in the city that day also). On Sunday we met Katie's parents, and enjoyed a fine BBQ, before sadly having to head back home.

It occurred to me during this trip, that I was in the area exactly three years ago. This got me thinking (as I lay on the beach that Saturday) about how much has changed in that time... but lets avoid the nostalgia for now... that's for another day.

Anyhow, a big thanks to Katie, her parents and everyone who I spent this weekend with, it has seriously been one to remember. Boop!
