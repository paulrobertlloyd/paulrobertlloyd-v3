Being a massive fan of <cite>The Adam & Joe Show</cite>, it was a happy day when I discovered [Adam Buxton's blog][1]. Better still, over the last few weeks he has been uploading some short interviews he made with Ken Korda for <cite>The Last Word</cite> on More4.

Kenneth Korda is a big figure in Hollywood, and given his involvement in some recent films (sometimes working closely with the directors), meant he was just the man Channel 4 were looking for to get an insight into their production:

* Chief Winky Wrangler on the set of [<cite>Battle In Heaven</cite>](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/kenkordabattleinheaven.mp4)
* Jim Jarmusch's Sandwich Supervisor during the filming of [<cite>Broken Flowers</cite>](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/kenkordabrokenflowers.mp4)
