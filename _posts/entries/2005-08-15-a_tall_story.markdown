Today finally saw the end of a long journey, one that I have been on since I was 8 years old. Whilst I finished taking growth hormone some years ago, since that time I have been involved in a medical trial, been given concerns about other possibly deficient hormones and for the last two years had check-ups every 6 months. Until today.

This journey saw me visit London many times during my childhood too. Days off from school would see an exciting, usually rushed journey into London, waiting in-line for my appointments in a number of different hospitals including [Great Ormond Street][1], before then going on to visit my Auntie in the Home Office restaurant with views across the capital. During one of these visits, I also seem to remember the tastiest Big Mac I ever did eat, but I guess back then these sort of things were more of a treat.

So here I am, with an average height (5' 8") but hopefully more than an average story to tell.
