Apple today announced the release date for [Mac OS X 10.4][1] -- 29th April 2005. Apart from the fact that [Mail][2] seems to have remained an interface oversight, and dashboard seems a little bit like overkill, I still can't wait to get my hands on this. [Spotlight][3] looks like one of those applications we wondered how we ever coped without.

However this relies on two other big announcements expected this month. The first is the opening of the Apple Store in Birmingham's Bullring shopping center, and the other being the [rumoured PowerMac G5 update][4].
