Channel 4 News focuses on in-depth quality reporting, yet the previous website was centred around breaking news. This was forcing their editorial staff into a constant cycle of small updates rather than allowing them to address deeper stories.

In collaboration with [James Box][1], [James Bates][2] and [Cathy Jones][3], I helped design an innovative and bold website that drew upon their on air brand, highlighted the broadcasting talent and showcased in-depth reporting by means of curated 'Special Reports'. I was later involved in the design of the companion iPad app, that took the design of the website and adapted it to suit the requirements of a touch based interface.
