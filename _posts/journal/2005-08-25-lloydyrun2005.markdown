In just over three weeks time, I will once again travelling up to the lovely North-East and running the Great North Run. Starting in Newcastle and finishing by the coast at South Shields, the totally distance is 13.1 miles.

As I did in 2003, I have again decided to raise money for my chosen charity, The Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK. This fund was set up in memory of Bobby Moore, captain of the 1966 World Cup winning team, often regarded as the gentleman of football, and who died of bowel cancer in 1993. Since then, the fund has raised over £4 million for bowel cancer research.

This year, sponsoring me couldn't be easier as I have set up an online donation page. Here you can choose to donate straight away or pay on my completion of the event, and it's all very easy to use. This is the preferred method of sponsorship as it makes everything so much easier for everybody who wishes to support me. The page (and further information) can be found at:

Remember any amount is a good amount, and I appreciate your support.
